# Build environment — blocker and options

## The problem

The current development Mac cannot build this app. This is not a configuration
issue; it is a hard version wall.

Verified on 2026-07-25:

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| This Mac | MacBook Pro 13" 2019 (`MacBookPro15,4`), Intel i5, 8 GB RAM |
| Current OS | macOS 13.7.5 Ventura |
| Xcode installed | none — Command Line Tools only |
| Free disk | ~3 GB (rechecked 3 August 2026) |

Apple's rule, in force since **28 April 2026**: builds uploaded to App Store
Connect **must be made with Xcode 26 or later, using the iOS 26 SDK**.
([Apple developer news](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/?id=02032026a))

- Xcode 26 requires **macOS 15.6 Sequoia** or later.
- The newest Xcode that runs on macOS 13 Ventura is **Xcode 15.3** — far below
  the requirement.
- Confirmed in practice: `brew install xcodegen` on this machine fails with
  *"Xcode 15.3 cannot be installed on macOS 13. You must upgrade your version of
  macOS."*

So: no TestFlight build can come off this machine as it stands.

## Options

### Option A — Upgrade this Mac (free, ~2-3 hours, some risk)

`MacBookPro15,4` **is** on the macOS Sequoia compatibility list, so the upgrade
path exists:

1. Free up disk. Sequoia needs ~25 GB free to install, and Xcode 26 needs a
   further ~35 GB. Currently there is only about 3 GB. **This is the real
   obstacle** — roughly 50 GB must be cleared.
2. Upgrade macOS 13.7.5 → Sequoia 15.6+.
3. Install Xcode 26.3 (the Universal build direct from Apple; the `xcodes`
   installer has a known bug on Intel).

Caveats: 8 GB RAM and a 1.4 GHz i5 make Xcode 26 slow but workable. This Mac
cannot run macOS 26 Tahoe (not on the Intel list), so the next time Apple raises
the SDK floor, this machine is stranded for good.

### Option B — Xcode Cloud — RULED OUT

This was the original recommendation and it does not work without a Mac.

Apple's docs state plainly: *"You need to configure your first Xcode Cloud
workflow in Xcode."* The App Store Connect web UI only edits workflows for apps
already onboarded, which is why its Xcode Cloud tab shows nothing but an
"Open Xcode" button. The API is no help either — `POST /v1/ciWorkflows` requires
an existing `ciProduct`, and `/v1/ciProducts` is read-only.

Xcode Cloud can only be reached *through* Xcode, which needs macOS 15.6.

### Option C — GitHub Actions `macos-26` runners — CHOSEN

The `macos-26` image ships Xcode 26.x. The TestFlight workflow requests
cloud-managed signing with `xcodebuild -allowProvisioningUpdates` and an App
Store Connect API key, so no certificate should need to be created by hand.
This account-specific signing path remains unverified until the first archive.
No local Xcode, macOS upgrade, or Xcode Cloud bootstrap step is required.

Set up in `CI-TESTFLIGHT.md`. This repository is public, so standard hosted
runners are currently free and unlimited. Release uploads remain manual as a
deployment-safety control, while source-only iOS builds run when iOS files
change.

### Option D — Borrow or rent a Mac

Any Mac running Sequoia 15.6+ works, including an Apple Silicon machine
belonging to someone else. A rented cloud Mac (MacStadium and similar) is
roughly $99-139/month — hard to justify at this project's size.

## Recommendation

**Option C (GitHub Actions)**. It is the only route that needs neither a local
Xcode nor a macOS upgrade, and unlike Xcode Cloud it has no Xcode-only
bootstrap step.

If iteration speed becomes painful — and for CallKit work it may, since every
test needs a real device anyway — clearing 50 GB and doing Option A gives a
proper local loop. The two are not exclusive: CI remains the release pipeline
either way.

## What is unaffected

All application code, configuration, the CSR, and the Telnyx and Apple portal
setup are done or ready. The build machine is purely about *where the compiler
runs*; none of the work above needs redoing whichever option is chosen.
